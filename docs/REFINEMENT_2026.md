# Refinement Notes for 2026

## Date Context Update

As we approach 2026, several areas may need attention:

### 1. Documentation References
- Research papers and publication dates
- Best practices documentation (e.g., "Rust CLI best practices 2024")
- Version references and compatibility notes

### 2. Code Comments
- Model version references
- Publication dates in code comments
- Example dates in documentation

### 3. Best Practices
- CLI design patterns should reflect current 2026 standards
- Library usage patterns (clap, etc.) should use latest patterns
- Error handling approaches should align with 2026 Rust ecosystem

## Current Status

**Date References Found**:
- `src/lib.rs`: References to "EMNLP 2025" and arxiv:2507 (GLiNER2 model)
- Documentation: Some references to "2024 best practices"

**Action Items**:
1. ✅ Review and update date-sensitive documentation
2. ⏳ Update model publication references if needed
3. ⏳ Ensure best practices reflect 2026 standards

## Notes

- Model publication dates (e.g., EMNLP 2025) are historical facts and should remain accurate
- Best practices documentation should reference current year when discussing "latest" practices
- Code examples and tutorials should use current patterns
